## NRV ContainerDay Feedback

This repo provides the frontend client for the session feedback tool.  The idea is that feedback will be submitted through this web app after running it using a container!

## Development

You should be able to get everything up and running by simply running

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You may also want to run the `nrvcontainerday/feedback-api` locally as well during testing.
